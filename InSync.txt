#hint: Mean Reversion ENTRY Strategy. The default inputs are based on stocks that are more volatile in nature. If you prefer to trade less volatile stocks, you should lower the extremities input. This strategy looks for long term trending stocks above EMA300, SMA200; Also, there are additional filters in place to ensure a better entry signal. The strategy is based on closing prices of the day of signal, so buy as close to the EOD as possible. The target is the high price of the day of entry. Ideal hold times are less than 5 days. On day 5, the position moves to breakeven. Optimized for use on daily charts.
